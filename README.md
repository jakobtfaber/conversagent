## ✨ Key Features

1. **Fast Inference** – Cerebras API powers the browser with ultra-fast LLM inference, enabling lightning fast command execution and responsive voice control.
2. **Natural-language browser control** – Say commands like "*Click the sign-in button*" and Stagehand executes them.
3. **Continuous Voice Streaming** – Speak naturally; no button presses required. Completely hands free.
4. **Real-time STT (Cartesia)** – Fast, accurate transcription via Cartesia's streaming ink-whisper model.
5. **Direct Command Execution** – Scroll commands are handled instantly, other commands go directly to Stagehand.
6. **Cross-platform** – macOS / Linux (requires FFmpeg).e
